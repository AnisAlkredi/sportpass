## 🎯 Key Features

### Business Model
- ✅ Pure wallet system (no subscriptions)
- ✅ Pay-per-check-in (deducted instantly)
- ✅ 80/20 commission split (gym/platform)
- ✅ Cash top-up with admin verification
- ✅ Manual gym settlement

### Technical Architecture
- ✅ 3-wallet system (user, gym, platform)
- ✅ Immutable ledger (append-only audit trail)
- ✅ Idempotent transactions (double-spend protection)
- ✅ Atomic check-ins (3 ledger entries in 1 transaction)
- ✅ Geo-fence validation (haversine distance)
- ✅ Static QR codes (Syria-optimized)
- ✅ Row-level security (role-based isolation)

### Roles
- **Athlete:** Browse gyms, check in, manage wallet, top up
- **Gym Owner:** Own gyms + athlete capabilities, view-only wallet
- **Admin:** Full control, approve top-ups, settle gyms, adjust balances

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Fresh Supabase project ([create here](https://app.supabase.com))
- Twilio account for phone OTP (Syria +963 support)
- Flutter development environment

### Deploy in 5 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Create Supabase project
# Record: Project URL, Anon Key

# 2. Open SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
# Copy entire supabase/schema.sql → Paste → Execute

# 3. Verify deployment
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
-- Expected: 11 tables

# 4. Configure Phone Auth
# Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Phone
# Enable phone auth, add Twilio credentials

# 5. Create first admin
# Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Add user
# Then in SQL Editor:
UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

# 6. Update Flutter .env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...

# 7. Run smoke test (optional but recommended)
# Copy supabase/smoke_test.sql → Execute
# Verify all tests pass ✓

# Done! 🎉
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. User Top-Up Flow
```
User uploads ShamCash receipt
→ Admin verifies proof image  
→ Admin approves request  
→ User wallet credited instantly
→ Balance shows in app
```

### 2. Check-In Flow
```
User scans gym QR code
→ App sends: QR token + GPS coordinates
→ Server validates:
  ✓ QR token valid
  ✓ GPS within geo-fence
  ✓ User has sufficient balance
→ Server executes (atomic):
  - Deduct from user wallet
  - Credit gym wallet (80%)
  - Credit platform wallet (20%)
  - Create checkin record
  - Create 3 ledger entries
→ User sees success + new balance
```

### 3. Gym Settlement Flow
```
Gym accumulates earnings in gym wallet
→ Admin reviews balances
→ Admin initiates settlement (records payout)
→ Admin pays gym externally (cash/bank)
→ Admin marks settlement as paid
→ Gym owner sees settlement in history
```

---

## 💰 Pricing Example

**Gym sets:** `base_price = 10,000 SYP` (their 80% share)

**System calculates:**
```
user_price = CEIL((10,000 / 0.80) / 500) × 500 = 12,500 SYP
platform_fee = 12,500 - 10,000 = 2,500 SYP
```

**On check-in:**
- User pays: **12,500 SYP** (100%)
- Gym receives: **10,000 SYP** (80%)
- Platform receives: **2,500 SYP** (20%)

All amounts are **rounded up to nearest 500 SYP**.

## 🏗️ Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `profiles` | User data | role (athlete/gym_owner/admin), status |
| `wallets` | User wallets | balance, total_topup, total_spent |
| `gym_wallets` | Gym wallets | partner_id, balance, total_earned |
| `platform_wallet` | Platform wallet | balance (singleton) |
| `wallet_ledger` | All transactions | wallet_type, amount, idempotency_key |
| `checkins` | Visit records | base_price, platform_fee, final_price |
| `partners` | Gym brands | owner_id, is_active |
| `partner_locations` | Gym branches | lat, lng, base_price, radius_m |
| `qr_tokens` | QR codes | token, is_active |
| `topup_requests` | Cash deposits | amount, proof_url, status |
| `settlements` | Gym payouts | amount, period, status |

### Key Functions (SECURITY DEFINER)
- `perform_checkin()` — Atomic check-in with commission split
- `approve_topup()` / `reject_topup()` — Top-up approval
- `admin_adjust_wallet()` — Manual balance adjustment
- `settle_gym_wallet()` — Gym settlement
- `generate_qr_token()` — QR code management
- `get_provider_analytics()` — Gym owner dashboard stats

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Gym owners can only access their own gyms
- Admins have full access
- Public can browse active gyms (for map)

### Anti-Fraud Protection
- **Idempotency keys:** Prevent double-spend on retry
- **Wallet locking:** Serialize concurrent transactions
- **Server-side pricing:** Client cannot manipulate prices
- **Geo-fence validation:** User must be physically present
- **Immutable ledger:** Complete audit trail
- **Device hashing:** Track suspicious patterns

### Admin Controls
- All admin actions logged with `admin_id`
- Ledger entries cannot be deleted (even by admin)
- Wallet adjustments require mandatory reason
- Secondary admin can audit primary admin

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Smoke Test
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor
# Execute: supabase/smoke_test.sql

# Expected output:
# ✅ 3 users created (admin, athlete, gym owner)
# ✅ 1 top-up approved (athlete balance = 500,000 SYP)
# ✅ 1 check-in completed (balance deducted, gym credited)
# ✅ All wallet balances match ledger sums
```

## 📱 Flutter Integration

### Initialize Supabase Client
```dart
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

await Supabase.initialize(
  url: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_URL']!,
  anonKey: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_ANON_KEY']!,
);

final supabase = Supabase.instance.client;
```

### Perform Check-In
```dart
final result = await supabase.rpc('perform_checkin', params: {
  'p_qr_token': scannedQrToken,
  'p_lat': position.latitude,
  'p_lng': position.longitude,
  'p_device_hash': await getDeviceHash(),
  'p_idempotency_key': generateIdempotencyKey(),
});

if (result['success'] == true) {
  // Success! Show animation
  showSuccess(
    pricePaid: result['price_paid'],
    newBalance: result['new_balance'],
    gymName: result['gym_name'],
  );
} else {
  // Failed - show error
  showError(result['message']);
}
```

### Real-Time Wallet Updates
```dart
supabase
  .from('wallets')
  .stream(primaryKey: ['id'])
  .eq('user_id', currentUser.id)
  .listen((data) {
    final balance = data.first['balance'];
    setState(() => _balance = balance);
  });
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Phone OTP not sending
**Solution:** Check Twilio credentials, verify Syria (+963) is enabled in account

### Issue: Check-in fails with "GEO_FAIL"
**Solution:** Verify gym GPS coordinates are correct, check radius_m is reasonable (50-500m)

### Issue: Ledger doesn't match wallet
**Solution:** This should NEVER happen if using SECURITY DEFINER functions. Run reconciliation query in smoke test.

### Issue: User can't check in (frozen account)
**Solution:** Admin must unfreeze: `UPDATE profiles SET status = 'active' WHERE user_id = '...'`

### Issue: RLS blocking legitimate requests
**Solution:** Check user role: `SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()`
